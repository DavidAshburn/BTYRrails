The Complete Riggers Apprentice is a book for sailors who want the satisfaction and hard-cash savings of stepping their own masts, inspecting and maintaining their own rigs, and turning up their own tailsplices and wire eyesplices. It is for boat owners who want to replace an entire gang of rigging themselves--measuring, choosing appropriate wire, making soft eyes, leathering, and serving.

This is the world's second most expensive fid; the most expensive being those fids that cut and disturb your rope as you use them! The Point Hudson Phid makes a smaller hole in the rope than ordinary fids, so a smoother fairer splice results, with no hockles or sliced yarns. The Phid is round and polished with no sharp edges to damage the rope fibers. It is easy to enter, even into hard-laid rope. The Phid is designed with an artful “cutaway 148;, so you can leave it in the rope while tucking the strand; no more yanking and dragging to get the strand home. The Phid is truly a beautiful tool, a marvel of functional elegance.", "The small works rope 5/16 - 5/8 inches", "The large works rope 3/4 - 1 1/8 inches"], "maker":"", "created_at":"2023-05-14T08:56:02.638Z", "updated_at":"2023-05-14T08:56:02.638Z", "category_id":5}
